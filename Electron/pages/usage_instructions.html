    <h3>Adding documents</h3>
    <p>There are two ways to add documents to your library:</p>
    <p>
        <div>
            Use Alt+A to capture document. 
        </div>
        <div>
            Use Alt+C to capture contents of the clipboard (use ctrl+C to copy text to your clipboard first). 
        </div>
    </p>
    <h3>Searching</h3>
    <p>Librarian supports a wide range of complex queries</p>
    <div>
        <p>
            <div>
                Use wildcard '*' to get all your recently added documents.
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>
                By default searches will look for full words that appear in a document.
            </div>
            <div>
                A document containing "Brown fox jumped." will only show up when you enter "jumped". 
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>More advanced users can use "*" for wider search radius. </div>
            <div>A document containing "Brown fox jumped." will show up for the search term "jump*".</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>Searches by default look for documents containing all the words in the search bar. </div>
            <div>If you want to search for documents containing <b>any</b> of the words, add "OR" between your keywords in the search bar. </div>
            <div>
                Ex: "brown OR jumped"
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>Librarian supports negative keywords. If you want a document to <b>not</b> contain 
                a word add a "-" character in front of the keyword. </div>
            <div>Ex: "brown OR -walked" </div>
        </p>
    </div>
