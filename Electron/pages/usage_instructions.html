    <h3>Adding documents</h3>
    <p>There are two ways to add documents to your library:</p>
    <p>
        <div>
            Use Alt+A to capture a screenshot of the foreground app.
        </div>
        <div>
            Use Alt+C to capture the contents of the clipboard (use ctrl+C to copy text to your clipboard first). 
        </div>
    </p>
    <h3>Searching</h3>
    <p>Librarian supports a wide range of complex queries.</p>
    <div>
        <p>
            <div>
                Use '*' to get your most recently added documents.
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>
                Search results will only bring up exact matches of your terms by default.
            </div>
            <div>
                A document containing "The brown fox jumped" will only show up when you type "jumped", but not for "jump"
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>More advanced users can use "*" for a wider search radius. </div>
            <div>Now, the search term "jump*" will bring up the document "The brown fox jumped" in the search results.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>Searches by default look for documents containing <b>all</b> the words in the search bar. </div>
            <div>If you want to search for documents containing <b>any</b> of the words, add "OR" between your keywords in the search bar. </div>
            <div>
                Ex: "brown OR jumped"
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>Librarian supports negative keywords. If you want a document to <b>not</b> contain 
                a word add a "-" character in front of the keyword. </div>
            <div>Ex: "brown OR jump* -walked" </div>
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
